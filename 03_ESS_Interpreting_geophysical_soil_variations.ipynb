    "These include:\n",
    "- FDEM_surveydata: full survey dataset of the Bottelare testfield;\n",
    "- FDEM_transect: extract of the survey dataset along a reference transect. You can use this to test analytical procedures, which you can then deploy across the full survey dataset;\n",
    "- sampling_data: calibration and validation sample dataset, collected as two independent stratified random sample sets (samples 1 - 10 =  calibration; 11 - 15 =  validation).\n",
